formInputDemo
=============

Simple demo featuring:

CSS Based Animated Modal inspired by [Mary Lou](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/06/25/nifty-modal-window-effects/)
  
AngularJs:
- magic of ng-model, scope, and data-binding
- form validation. Great stuff @ [scotch.io](http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/angularjs-form-validation)

Scalable | Modular Best Practices:
- module based file structure. see [this medium article](https://medium.com/opinionated-angularjs/scalable-code-organization-in-angularjs-9f01b594bf06) by Gert Hengeveld for furthur reference.
- [inuitcss](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/) and [cssguidlin.es](http://cssguidelin.es/) influenced SASS file structure, commenting, and naming convention
